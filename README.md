The software is created in order to be able to check diffrent Fortigate configuration (version 4 and 5).
Because the Fortigate configs are not consistent in version 4 this first implementation is intended for version 5 and will be updated with the features to parse also version 4.


Features to be build in:

-Move the file read function to the main() method.
-Abstact the Fortigate_Check class in order to provide a security list  that should be processed by the Fortigate_Check class
